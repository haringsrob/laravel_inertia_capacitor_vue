This extends the laravel-vue-inertia starter kit.

This is a quick proof of concept for building a capacitor app based on InertiaJs and vue.

It builds on top of https://github.com/GTCrais/capacitor-inertia-vue-laravel/tree/master 
but then updated to work with current laravel version.

It is by no means fully ready. But can be a source of inspiration for others.

Dont:
- Use links like /account, instead use ziggy routes at all times.

Todo:
- [ ] Enable cors
